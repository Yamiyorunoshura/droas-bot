## Non-functional Requirements Architecture


### 性能架構 (Performance Architecture)

```yaml
message_processing:
  target_latency: "< 5 seconds (p95)"
  throughput: "數條消息/分鐘 per group"
  
tool_calls:
  target_latency: "< 2 seconds (p95)"
  concurrency: "支持並發調用"

optimization_techniques:
  - "Rust async runtime with tokio"
  - "Connection pooling for HTTP clients"
  - "Bounded channels for backpressure control"
  - "Local caching for frequent metadata"
```

### 可用性架構 (Availability Architecture)

```yaml
uptime_target: "99% annually"

fault_tolerance:
  supervisor_pattern: "Auto-restart failed child bots"
  health_checks: "Periodic liveness/readiness checks"
  graceful_shutdown: "SIGTERM handling with cleanup"
  
monitoring:
  health_endpoints: "/health, /ready"
  alerting: "Discord webhook notifications"
  recovery_time: "< 30 seconds for bot restart"
```

### 安全性架構 (Security Architecture)

```yaml
secrets_management:
  injection_method: "Environment variables only"
  storage_encryption: "SOPS/age for config files"
  log_redaction: "Automatic PII/token masking"
  
access_control:
  principle: "Least privilege"
  api_permissions: "Scoped bot tokens"
  audit_logging: "All sensitive operations logged"
```

### 可觀測性架構 (Observability Architecture)  

```yaml
structured_logging:
  format: "JSON with trace_id"
  levels: ["DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR"]
  
metrics:
  system: "Prometheus format"
  custom: ["message_count", "error_rate", "api_calls"]
  
alerting:
  triggers: ["API quota exhaustion", "consecutive errors", "connection failures"]
  channels: ["Discord webhooks", "Email notifications"]
```
