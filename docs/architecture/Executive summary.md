## Executive summary

This project delivers a Discord bot (implemented in Rust) that welcomes new members in a guild by posting a message and attaching a personalized welcome image. The bot supports per-guild configuration (welcome channel and background image), resilient event handling, and rate-limit-aware interactions with Discord APIs. The architecture emphasizes simplicity for the MVP (local or free-tier storage), low operational cost, and clear pathways to scale.
